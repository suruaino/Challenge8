## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwindcss

### Continued development

In future projects, I will like to focus on using javaScript for the toggle interactivities. Did everything with css but am sure it could be lesser work with javascript.

I will want to use this opportunity to thank my lovely sister Ojeifo Loveth and her husband Obende Daniel for their support and encouragement. They kept pushing me right from the day I started this journey till date. They never got tired. I want to say that I really appreciate.
